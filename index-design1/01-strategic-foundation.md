# Phase 1: Strategic Foundation

**Status:** üü° In Progress
**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025

## 1. Core Value Proposition

### The 5-Second Test
*What must visitors understand in 5 seconds?*

**Answer:**
"We are a prop firm that genuinely only profits when you do."

**Key Sub-Messages:**
- Free entry (proof of confidence, not gimmick)
- We're fighting against the industry's 4% pass rate model
- Our business model is aligned with YOUR success, not your failure

**NOT:** Just another firm with free entry
**BUT:** A fundamentally different business model where trader success = firm success

---

### What Makes IPFX Genuinely Different?
*Not marketing speak - the real, defensible differences*

**Primary Differentiators:**

1. **Free Entry + Insurance Model (THE CORE)**
   - **Free entry** removes barrier to entry, proves we're confident in traders
   - **Insurance model** shows we want traders to KEEP their funded accounts
   - Traditional prop firms maximize profit by maximizing failure rates
   - IPFX maximizes profit by maximizing trader longevity and success
   - This is a **partnership model**, not a churn-and-burn model

2. **Personalized Challenge Terms (For Experts)**
   - For proven traders who know they're capable
   - Still free if you pass YOUR OWN terms
   - Pay only if you fail by your own parameters
   - **"Set your own stop loss"** - follows core ethos of discipline and risk management
   - Shows respect for expertise while maintaining accountability

3. **Business Model Alignment**
   - Industry standard: Profit from entry fees + account failures
   - IPFX model: Profit from trader success, long-term partnerships, revenue share
   - Insurance protects traders from reset cycles
   - B-book ‚Üí A-book progression builds trust and real capital deployment

**The Ethos:**
Discipline, risk management, transparency, genuine partnership.

### The Emotional Hook
*What feeling should visitors have? What desire are we tapping into?*

**Primary Emotion: CURIOSITY**
"This sounds too good to be true... but what if it's real?"

**Emotional Journey:**
1. **Curiosity** ‚Üí Need to know more, investigate if legitimate
2. **Hope** ‚Üí "Maybe this is the fair shot I've been looking for"
3. **Excitement** ‚Üí "This could actually work for me"
4. **Trust** ‚Üí "I can verify this is legitimate" (evidence-based)

**Critical Challenge:**
The offer sounds too good to be true. The site must LEAN INTO this skepticism and systematically dismantle it with proof, transparency, and clear business logic.

**The "Aha" Moment:**
When visitors understand: "Oh, they make MORE money if I succeed long-term than if I fail quickly. The incentives are actually aligned."
