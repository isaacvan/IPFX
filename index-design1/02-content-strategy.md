## 4. Story Arc

### Narrative Type
*What narrative are we telling?*

**Selected Approach: Hybrid Model**

Combines elements of:
1. **Bold Claim** (Option 2): Lead with "We only profit when you do"
2. **Problem → Solution** (Option 1): Reveal broken industry, show how IPFX fixes it
3. **Dual Path** (Option 5): Clear fork for different experience levels

**Primary Emphasis:**
- Make it EASY to join Infinity Challenge (biggest audience)
- Show experienced traders their unique value quickly (most valuable clients)

**Narrative Structure:**
"We only profit when you do [bold claim] → The prop industry is broken (4% pass rates, misaligned incentives) [problem] → Here's how we fix it with aligned incentives [solution] → Choose your path based on experience level [dual path]"

---

### Emotional Beats
*As users scroll, what should they feel?*

| Section | Emotional Beat | What User Thinks |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **Hero** | Curiosity + Intrigue | "Wait... free? We profit when you do? How?" |
| **Industry Problem** | Recognition | "Yes! This IS the problem I've faced" |
| **How IPFX Fixes It** | Understanding + Hope | "Oh, their incentives ARE aligned with mine" |
| **Dual Path Fork** | Clarity | "This is the path for ME specifically" |
| **Infinity Challenge** | Excitement | "I can start this RIGHT NOW for free!" |
| **PAC + Pot System** | Intrigue (Experienced) | "Wait, passive income? Account security?" |
| **Trust Elements** | Credibility | "Okay, this is legitimate" |
| **Social Proof** | Validation | "Real people are succeeding here" |
| **CTA** | Confidence | "I'm ready to start" |

**Key Decision:**
- Skepticism doesn't need immediate addressing
- Build interest FIRST, then systematically dismantle skepticism
- Business model explanation present but not immediately after hero

---

### Logical Flow
*Information architecture from top to bottom*

**Approach: Hybrid of #2 & #3 (Primary Focus + Parallel Paths)**

```
1. HERO
   - Bold claim: "We only profit when you do"
   - FREE Infinity Challenge prominent
   - Easy entry emphasized

2. INDUSTRY PROBLEM (Brief)
   - "The prop firm model is broken"
   - 4% pass rates, misaligned incentives
   - Keeps traders in failure cycles

3. HOW IPFX FIXES IT / BUSINESS MODEL
   - Our incentive alignment
   - Free entry + Insurance model
   - How we actually make money

4. DUAL PATH FORK
   - "New to trading or leveling up?" → Infinity Challenge
   - "Experienced and profitable?" → PAC + Pot System

5. INFINITY CHALLENGE SECTION (Primary - Volume)
   - How it works
   - Scaling path (double every +10%)
   - Free entry, zero risk
   - CTA: "Start Infinity Challenge"

6. PAC SECTION (Secondary - High Value)
   - For experienced traders
   - Set your own terms
   - Account security (insurance)
   - CTA: "Apply for PAC"

7. POT SYSTEM (Connector)
   - For experienced: "Earn passive income from followers"
   - For learning: "Follow expert traders to improve"
   - Retention mechanism: "Didn't pass? Learn from the best"
   - Creates ecosystem between both audiences

8. TRUST ELEMENTS (Distributed Throughout)
   - Not just at end - woven into earlier sections
   - Business model explanation (Section 3)
   - Stats/proof points in relevant sections
   - Testimonials before final CTA

9. SOCIAL PROOF
   - Real trader stories
   - Verified results
   - Mix of experience levels

10. FINAL CTA SECTION
    - Dual CTAs: Infinity Challenge + PAC Application
    - Clear next steps
```

---

### Pot System Strategic Positioning

**Dual Function:**
1. **For Experienced Traders:** Primary benefit (passive income generation)
2. **For Learning Traders:** Retention mechanism after failure/struggle

**Key Insight:**
Pot system keeps learning traders engaged even if they fail initial challenge. "You can still improve by following experts while you work toward your next attempt."

**Placement Decision:**
- Mentioned in PAC section (primary value for experienced)
- Standalone section connecting both audiences
- Acts as bridge between volume and value segments

---

### Trust Element Distribution

**Early Trust (Higher Up):**
- Business model explanation (Section 3)
- Basic statistics (funded traders count)
- Quick credibility markers

**Later Trust (Deeper Engagement):**
- Detailed testimonials
- Payout proof
- Regulatory information

**Strategy:**
Progressive trust-building throughout scroll, not dumped at end

---

## 5. Section Requirements

### Above the Fold Requirements
*What MUST be visible without scrolling (700-900px)*

**Non-Negotiable Elements:**
1. **Headline** - "We only profit when you do" message
2. **FREE Infinity Challenge** - Prominently emphasized
3. **Primary CTA** - Clear action button

**Must Convey (Even if user doesn't scroll):**
- This is something DIFFERENT
- It's FREE (genuinely)
- This is a NEW business model (not another prop firm clone)

**Goal:** If they see ONLY the hero, they should be curious enough to scroll.

---

### Depth vs Brevity Strategy

**Overall Philosophy: Gateway with Substance**
- Homepage is primarily a GATEWAY to deeper content
- Must be attractive: "Wow, this is proper"
- Must build trust
- NOT text-heavy
- Excellent white space balance
- Some explanations needed, but links for depth

**Section-Specific Depth:**

**Business Model Explanation:**
- **Approach:** Visual diagrams + brief clear explanation
- **Deep Dive:** Link to dedicated page OR detailed FAQ
- **Question to resolve:** Separate "How We Work" page or fold into FAQ? (Avoid overlap)

**Infinity Challenge:**
- **Approach:** Mix of overview + excitement
- **Length:** Not text-heavy, enough to make them want dedicated page
- **Interactive:** Not essential for this section

**Pot System:**
- **Approach:** Brief teaser (Option A)
- **Must include:** Profitability example
- **Audience:** Primarily for experienced traders
- **Deep dive:** Link to dedicated page

---

### Visual Impact Requirement

**User Reaction Goal:**
When new user scrolls down: "Wow, this is proper."

**Must Balance:**
- Trust signals
- Clean design
- White space
- Excitement
- Professionalism

**Key:** Make them FEEL the quality before they read the details

---

## 6. Messaging Hierarchy

### Primary Headlines (The Big Statements)

**Hero Headline:**
"The capital platform that only profits from your successes, not your failures."

**Rationale:**
- Uses "the platform" not "we" - separates company from profit motive
- Makes it about the system/model, not the people
- Avoids feeling corporate or self-serving
- Clear contrast: successes vs failures

**Alternative considerations:**
- "Trading capital that wants you to win" - good but less direct
- "The prop firm with aligned incentives" - too jargony
- ❌ "Free capital. Real opportunity. Zero catch." - too tacky, triple bullets feel salesy
- ❌ "We profit together" - too corny

---

**Industry Problem Headline:**
"The prop firm model is broken"

**Supporting angle:**
- System designed to make traders fail
- IPFX model designed to make traders win
- Sets up the contrast

---

**Business Model Headline:**
~~"How we actually make money"~~ ❌ Too direct, sounds defensive

**Better approach:**
"Our model functions in this manner..." - show don't tell
- Don't say "how we make money" explicitly
- Explain the model so they can grasp it themselves
- Let them connect the dots: "Oh, they profit when I succeed"

**Potential headlines:**
- "How IPFX works"
- "A different kind of partnership"
- "Our model: Aligned incentives"
- Designer's choice, but avoid making it about "our profit"

---

**Infinity Challenge Headline:**
"You prove your talent. We provide your capital. Fair. Scalable. Transparent."

**Alternative:**
"Free entry. Real capital. Your success."

**Decision:** Both work, lean toward current version but open to refinement

---

### Supporting Messages (Subheads)

**Hero Subhead:**
Current: "You prove your talent, we provide your capital. Fair. Scalable. Transparent."

**Status:** Approved, but open to designer improvement if something better emerges

**Design note:** This is flexible - if during visual design phase something feels off, we can refine

---

**Infinity Challenge Subhead:**
Option 1: "Double your capital every +10% gain. No fees. No risk to your wallet."
Option 2: "From $10K simulated to unlimited real capital. You set the pace."

**Status:** Approved concepts, designer's choice for final wording

---

**Pot System Subhead (Dual Audience):**
- **For Experienced:** "Turn your edge into passive income"
- **For Learning:** "Learn from the best while you improve"

**Status:** ✅ Approved - different messaging for buyer vs seller of signals

---

### Proof Points (Stats, Facts, Claims)

**Current Numbers (Temporary/Placeholder):**
- 1,248 traders funded
- 3,000 pre-registered members
- 10 min average payout time
- 312 scaled to real capital

**Note:** These are NOT real yet, used for design purposes only

**Lead Proof Points (Most Compelling):**
1. **Total Capital Deployed** - "Managing $50M+ in trader capital" (or similar)
   - Shows scale even if simulated
   - Demonstrates serious operation
   - Most impressive number

2. **Traders Funded** - Shows volume of successful users

**Additional Proof Points to Develop:**
- ✅ **Pass Rate Comparison** - "Industry: 4% pass rate | IPFX: __%"
- **Total Payouts Disbursed** - Dollar amount
- **Partner Brands/Connections** - Logo credibility
- **Review Scores** - Trustpilot, etc. (when real)
- **Average Account Growth** - Show success trajectory
- **Active A-Book Users** - Real capital tier

**Creative Brief for Designer:**
Research and propose additional compelling proof points along these lines

---

### Risk Mitigation Messaging

**Approach: Hybrid (Options 1 + 2)**

**Strategy:**
- Address skepticism indirectly through business model section
- Don't call out "too good to be true" explicitly
- Make the business model SO CLEAR that the skepticism dissolves naturally
- Let them realize: "Oh, this ISN'T too good to be true because [business logic]"

**Tone:**
- Confident, not defensive
- Transparent, not protesting
- Educational, not apologetic

**Implementation:**
Business model section should be written so a skeptical person thinks:
"Okay, I see how they make money. I see why they want me to succeed. This makes sense."

**FAQ as Safety Net:**
Deep skeptics can go to FAQ for exhaustive transparency

---

### CTA Copy (Call-to-Action Button Text)

**Primary CTA (Infinity Challenge):**

**Requirements:**
- Must include "Infinity Challenge" explicitly
- Clear it's for starting NOW
- Action-oriented

**Options:**
- "Start Infinity Challenge" ✅ (recommended)
- "Start Infinity Challenge Free"
- "Begin Infinity Challenge"
- "Launch Infinity Challenge"

**Decision:** Designer's research-backed choice, but "Infinity Challenge" must be in the text

---

**Secondary CTA (Experienced Traders - PAC):**

**Requirements:**
- More formal tone
- Hints at application process
- Respects expertise

**Options:**
- "Submit PAC Application" ✅ (recommended)
- "Apply for Personalized Challenge"
- "Expert Trader Application"
- "Submit Your Application"

**Decision:** Designer's choice with formality constraint

---

**CTA Philosophy:**
- Action-focused for Infinity (youth audience: "Start")
- Process-focused for PAC (experienced audience: "Submit Application")
- Different tone for different maturity levels

---

### Tone Guidelines

**Overall Brand Voice:**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Transparent but not clinical
- Professional but not corporate
- Exciting but not hype-y

**Avoid:**
- Tacky bullet-pointed claims
- Corny "we're in this together" language
- Overly salesy tactics
- Defensive posturing

**Embrace:**
- Clear, honest statements
- System/model language over company language
- Facts over fluff
- Respect for user intelligence

---
