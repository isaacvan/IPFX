### Core Value Proposition

**Key Differentiators:**
- Free Entry + Insurance Model (partnership, not churn-and-burn)
- Personalized Challenge Terms ("set your own stop loss")
- Business model aligned with trader success

**Emotional Journey:** Curiosity → Hope → Excitement → Trust

**Critical Challenge:** Lean into "too good to be true" skepticism and dismantle it with proof

- Age 18-30, social media native

**Primary Audience #2: Experienced Traders**
- 2+ years, consistently profitable
- Pain: Need security + want passive income
- Path: PAC + Pot System (trade less, earn more)

**Two-Sided Marketplace:** Experienced traders provide signals to learning traders via pot system
